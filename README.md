# View my portfolio


Hey, my name’s Ethan. You are probably a server administrator or owner if you are being sent this link. I’d like to thank you for viewing this and giving me a chance. I will try to update this whenever I resign or get hired to a server. I’ll have two categories (Present & Past). 



What I offer
I am a professional, kind, and supportive moderator. I have a few years of support (Dating back to 2020 [My other account was terminated by Discord due to a reported scam]) Although, I would rather play soccer and go fishing, I do enjoy engaging with the community on Discord especially when I can provide support and moderation when it’s needed.
